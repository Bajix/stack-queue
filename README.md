A heapless auto-batching queue featuring deferrable batching by way of negotiating exclusive access over task ranges on thread-owned circular buffers. As tasks continue to be enqueued until batches are bounded, doing so can be deferred until after a database connection has been acquired as to allow for opportunitistic batching. This delivers optimal batching at all workload levels without batch collection overhead, superfluous timeouts, nor unnecessary allocations.

## Usage

Impl one of the following while using the [local_queue](https://docs.rs/stack-queue/latest/stack_queue/attr.local_queue.html) macro:

* [`TaskQueue`](https://docs.rs/stack-queue/latest/stack_queue/trait.TaskQueue.html), for batching with per-task receivers
* [`BackgroundQueue`](https://docs.rs/stack-queue/latest/stack_queue/trait.BackgroundQueue.html), for background processsing task batches without receivers
* [`BatchReducer`](https://docs.rs/stack-queue/latest/stack_queue/trait.BatchReducer.html), for using closures to reduce over batched data

## Runtime Configuration

By utilizing a barrier to guard thread local data destruction until runtime threads rendezvous during shutdown, it becomes possible to create thread-safe pointers to thread-local data owned by runtime worker threads. In order for [async-local](https://docs.rs/async-local) to protect thread local data within an async context, the provided barrier-protected Tokio Runtime must be used to ensure tasks never outlive thread local data owned by worker threads. By default, this crate makes no assumptions about the runtime used, and comes with the `leaky-context` feature flag enabled which prevents [Context<T>](https://docs.rs/async-local/latest/async_local/struct.Context.html) from ever deallocating by using [Box::leak](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.leak); to avoid this extra indirection, disable `leaky-context` and configure the runtime using the [tokio::main](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/attr.main.html) or [tokio::test](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/attr.test.html) macro with the `crate` attribute set to `async_local` with only the `barrier-protected-runtime` feature flag set on [`async-local`](https://docs.rs/async-local).

## Stable Usage

This crate conditionally makes use of the nightly only feature [type_alias_impl_trait](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2515-type_alias_impl_trait.html) to allow async fns in traits to be unboxed. To compile on `stable` the `boxed` feature flag can be used to downgrade [async_t::async_trait](https://docs.rs/async_t/latest/async_t/attr.async_trait.html) to [async_trait::async_trait](https://docs.rs/async-trait/latest/async_trait).
